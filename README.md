- 👋 Hi, I’m @bhenrylynch
- 👀 I’m interested in computers and outdoors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Engineering at the University of Victoria
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of yet.

I'm content with anyone using my code for reference for their own personal projects. If using my code for academic or professional reasons, I strongly recommend proper references and credit to myself to ensure you do not jeopardize your future career. All the best!
